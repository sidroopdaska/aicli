I first kind of fell in love with the internet probably around the time we had aol, so a dial up connection. And I remember having to ask my parents permission to be able to go to the computer room to go on the internet cause it would block the phone line and, you know, it was limited in the amount of time I got to spend on it."

    paragraph: So obviously when the iPhone came out, that was pretty inspiring. But, um, I think I can remember one thing that I tried to do was I didn't think the internet was fast enough. And so I spent a lot of time on forums, uh, on how to potentially hack your, your cable modem, as well as changing the Windows registry values, uh, which would on the margin improve things.
