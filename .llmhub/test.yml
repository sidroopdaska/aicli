inputs:
  - "Um, and then in kind of around 2000, I think we got our first broadband connection. And I think that that was kind of the unlock for me in that you all, you could eat internet and Google had just come out. And so kind of this access to the world's information. I, I've always been a big fan of the book. The Hitchhikers got to the Galaxy and the idea of kind of having a computer in your pocket that could access kind of all known information was pretty cool."
  - "So obviously when the iPhone came out, that was pretty inspiring. But, um, I think I can remember one thing that I tried to do was I didn't think the internet was fast enough. And so I spent a lot of time on forums, uh, on how to potentially hack your, your cable modem, as well as changing the Windows registry values, uh, which would on the margin improve things."
  - "I think some of that was placebo, but it was actually my first kind of diving into the internals of thing that, that got me inspired to just kind of think about how systems work more broadly and, and especially computers. Um, self-talk programmer in, in kind of middle school, high school. It's funny, I never kind of took it super seriously."
  - "I don't have really have any engineers in my family, and so I, I didn't kind of think that that was a. A career that was, I don't know, as appealing or open to me. And so I thought of it as more of an interest. And so when we went to college, um, I ended up majoring in English cuz I thought I was gonna go to law school."
  - "And fortunately for me, I, I did an internship between my sophomore and junior year where I worked at the attorney general's office in Providence, Rhode Island in the narcotics and organized crime unit, which was a fascinating experience and, and you know, got to see how, how the criminal justice system worked up close."
  - "But I quickly realized I had no interest in being a lawyer. And that kind of led me to my junior of college where I did a little bit of soul search. And ended up kind of doubling down on just what I was interested in, which was technology. And I applied to a remote internship for TechCrunch, the the technology news blog, which I think is hard to appreciate for, for people who are a little younger, how big TechCrunch was at the time."
